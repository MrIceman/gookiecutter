# About this repository


This repository serves as collection of go packages I wrote and been re-using in my projects since.
Some of the most-frequent used packages from my side is pkg/dynorm, it's a wrapper around dynamoDB and sums up the most common operations into 1-2 lines.
It's mainly a collection of utils for me but feel free to use it or even contribute.

Another package is pkg/collctionoperation which contains monads for collections, like map, filter, reduce, etc.
